# DeepinMeetsArc
## What is DeepinMeetsArc?

[Deepin GTK theme](https://cr.deepin.io/#/admin/projects/deepin-gtk-theme) for GNOME fell in love with [Arc theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) and they had a baby. For the most part it's Deepin theme look, but with Arc accent colours, window buttons, and wiget styles for radio buttons, switches and many other.

This theme is mostly a mash up of those two themes, credits go to the authors or Deepin and Arc GTK themes.

## What happens when Deepin meets Arc?

You end up with beautiful flat GTK theme with transparent elements for GTK 3, GTK 2 and GNOME Shell, high contrast, beautiful whites and blacks and with Arc's blue accent.

## Installation

Clone the repository into `~/.themes` or as root into `/usr/share/themes` for global installation, you can also [download it as ZIP file](https://github.com/michaldaniel/DeepinMeetsArc/archive/master.zip). On GNOME you also want to install [Gnome Tweak Tool](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/GnomeTweakTool?action=show&redirect=GnomeTweakTool) and [User Themes plugin](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/19/user-themes/). Then use Tweaks Tool to change GTK and Shell theme to `DeepinMeetsArc`.

In future I'll look into getting it on Gnome Look website and packaging.

To uninstall just remove `DeepinMeetsArc` directory from place of installation.

## Bugs

If you find a bug please [report it here](https://github.com/michaldaniel/DeepinMeetsArc/issues/new). Note that I only tested it under Gnome 3.24 but theme should also work under 3.26.

## License

Both Arc theme and Deepin theme are aviable under GPL-3.0, and so is DeepinMeetsArc. See [LICENSE file](https://github.com/michaldaniel/DeepinMeetsArc/blob/master/LICENSE) for full license text.
